## Why Study Economics
### Three Fundamental concept
- **Opportunity Cost（机会成本）**  
  The full "cost" of making a choice includes what we give up by not making the alternative choice. E.g. the cost of watching a movie is not only the money but also the time.
- **Marginalism（边缘主义）**  
  The process of analyzing the additional or incremental costs or benefits arising from a choice or decision. E.g. as for an airplane, the total cost is roughly unchanged, so selling a few seats by big discounts is profitable.
- **Efficient Markets-No Free Lunch（高效市场）**  
  A maket in which profit opportunities are eliminated almost instantaneously. E.g. hot tip on the stock market will rise money soon.
### Microeconomics & Macroeconomics
- **Microeconomics**  
  The branch of economics that examines the funcitionning of individual industires and the behavior of individual decision-making units-that is, firms and households.
- **Macroeconomics**  
  The branch of economics that examines the economic behavior of aggregates—income, employment, output, and so on—on a national scale.
- **Difference**  
  Microeconomics is concerned with household income; macroeconomics deals with national income.  
  Microeconomics focuses on individual product prices and relative prices, macroeconomics looks at the overall price level and how quickly (or slowly) it is rising (or falling).  
  Microeconomics questions how many people will be hired (or fired) this year in a particular industry or in a certain geographic area and focuses on the factors that determine how much labor a firm or an industry will hire. Macroeconomics deals with aggregate employment and unemployment: how many jobs exist in the economy as a whole and how many people who are willing to work are not able to find work.
- **Microeconomics looks at the individual unit-the household, the firm, the industry. Macroeconomics looks at the natinal level**

### Method of Economics (Postive & Normative)
- **Positive Economics（实证经济学）**  
  An approach to economics that seeks to understand behavior and the operation of systems without making judgments. It describes what exists and how it works.  
  It don't care whether the outcomes are good or bad. 
- **Normative Economics（规范经济学）**
  In contrast of Positive Economics, An approach to economics that analyzes outcomes of economic behavior, evaluates them as good or bad, and may prescribe courses of action. Also called **policy economics**.
### Theories and Models
- **Model**  
  A formal statement of a theory, usually a mathematical statement of a presumed relationship between two or more variables.
- **Variable**  
  A measure that can change from time to time or from observation to observation
### Cations and Pitfalls
  &emsp;In formulating theories and models, it is especially important to separate **causation（因果关系）** from **correlation（相关性）**.
### Empirical Economics
  &emsp;The collection and use of data to test economic theories.

## Scarcity & Choice
### Three Basic Questions
- What gets produced? 
- How is it produced?
- Who gets what is produced?
### notions
- **captical**  
  Those goods produced by the economic system that are used as inputs to produce other goods and services in the future.
- **facotrs of production**  
  The inputs into the production process. Land, labor, and capital are the three key factors of production.
- **production**  
  The process that transforms scarce resources into useful goods and services.
- **Investment**  
  New capital additions to a firm's capital stock. Although capital is measured at a giben point in time, investments is measured over a period of time. the flow of investment increases the capital stock.
- **production possibility frontier(ppf)**  
  A graph that shows all the combinations of goods and services that can be produced if all of society’s resources are used efficiently.
- **Capital goods vs Consummer goods**  
  Capital goods and consumer goods are terms used to describe goods based on how they are used. A capital good is any good used to help increase future production. Consumer goods are those used by consumers and have no future productive use.
- **economic growth**  
  An increase in the total output of an economy. Growth occurs when a society acquires new resources or when it learns to produce more using existing resources.
### Economic Systems and the role of Government
- **Command Economies**  
  An economy in which a central government either directly or indirectyle sets output targets, incomes, and prices.
- **Market Economies/Laissez-faire economy(自由放任经济)**  
  An economy in which individual people and firms pursue their own self-intert without any government direction or regulation

## Demand, Supply, and Market Equilibrium  
### The basic decision-maing units:
- **Firms**: The primary producing units in an economy.
- **Households**: The consuming units in an economy.
### Demand in Product/Output Markets
- **Six Factors affect what to buy**
  - The price of the product in question.
  - The income available to the household.
  - The household’s amount of accumulated wealth.
  - The prices of other products available to the household.
  - The household’s tastes and preferences.
  - The household’s expectations about future income, wealth, and prices
- **Quantity Demanded**  
  The amount of a product that a household would buy in a given period if it could buy all it wanted at the current market price.  
### Changes in Quantity Demanded versus Changes in Demand
  &emsp;The most important relationship in individual markets is between market price and quantity demanded.
- **demand schedule**  
  Show how much of a given product a household would be willing to buy at different prices for a given time period.
- **demand curve**  
  A graph illustrating how much of a given product a household would be willing to buy at different prices.
- **law of demand**  
  THe negative relationship between price and quantity demanded.
- **market demand**  
   The sum of all the quantities of a good or service demanded per period by all the households buying in the market for that good or service.
